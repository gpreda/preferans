====================================
Consolidated from Serbian sources: preferansklub.com, preferans.neocities.org,
preferans.org. Translated and structured in English.


========================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
========================================================================

Preferans (also spelled Preference) is a Central/Eastern European trick-taking
card game, similar to Bridge. Strategy and tactics often have a greater effect
on the final result than the quality of the cards dealt. It is played by three
players using a 32-card deck, with a bidding (auction) phase followed by trick
play. Two players partner against the third (the declarer) each round.


========================================================================
2. PLAYERS
========================================================================

- Standard game: 3 players.
- With 4 players: one player sits out each round in rotation (the dealer
  does not play that round).
- Seating order is counter-clockwise.


========================================================================
3. THE DECK
========================================================================

- 32 cards: four suits (Spades, Diamonds, Hearts, Clubs), each containing
  7, 8, 9, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K), Ace (A).
- Card ranking (low to high): 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.
- Ace is the highest card.
- Suit ranking (low to high): Spades, Diamonds, Hearts, Clubs.


========================================================================
4. DETERMINING SEATING AND DEALER
========================================================================

- Before the match begins, each player draws a card.
- The player who draws the lowest card deals first.
- Seating order proceeds counter-clockwise from lowest to highest drawn card.
- In a 4-player game, the dealer sits out the first round.


========================================================================
5. SHUFFLING AND CUTTING
========================================================================

- Thorough shuffling is important because cards from the previous hand tend
  to be grouped by suit.
- The player to the dealer's LEFT cuts the deck. Cutting is optional but
  strongly recommended.


========================================================================
6. DEALING
========================================================================

- Dealing proceeds to the RIGHT (counter-clockwise).
- Deal pattern: 5 cards to each player, then 2 cards face-down to the
  center of the table (the TALON/KUP), then 5 more cards to each player.
- Each player receives 10 cards; 2 cards go to the talon.
- The player to the dealer's right receives cards first.


========================================================================
7. GAME TYPES AND BID VALUES
========================================================================

There are 6 game types, each with an associated bid value:

  Bid Value | Game Type          | Description
  ----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------
     2      | Spades (Pik)       | Spades as trump suit
     3      | Diamonds (Karo)    | Diamonds as trump suit
     4      | Hearts (Herc)      | Hearts as trump suit
     5      | Clubs (Tref)       | Clubs as trump suit
     6      | Betl               | No-trump; declarer must take ZERO tricks
     7      | Sans (Sanac)       | No-trump; declarer must take 6+ tricks

The four trump games (2-5) and Sans require the declarer to win at least 6
out of 10 tricks. Betl requires the declarer to win NO tricks at all.

"In hand" variants (igra/prijavljena igra) are bid one level higher:

  Bid Value | In-Hand Game Type
  ----------|---------------------------
     3      | In-Hand Spades (Igra Pik)
     4      | In-Hand Diamonds (Igra Karo)
     5      | In-Hand Hearts (Igra Herc)
     6      | In-Hand Clubs (Igra Tref)
     7      | In-Hand Betl (Igra Betl)
     8      | In-Hand Sans (Igra Sans)


========================================================================
8. BIDDING (LICITACIJA / AUCTION)
========================================================================

8.1 BASIC BIDDING
- The player who received cards first (to dealer's right) bids first.
- Bidding proceeds counter-clockwise.
- Players bid by naming a number (2-7) representing the minimum game they
  are willing to play.
- A player may say "dalje" (pass) to drop out of the bidding.
- Bidding continues until two players have passed.
- The remaining player is the DECLARER (nositelj/nosac igre).

8.2 "MOGU" (I CAN)
- A player may say "mogu" meaning "I can play that game too" — matching the
  current bid rather than raising.
- The previous bidder must then raise or pass.

8.3 WINNING THE AUCTION
- The auction winner (declarer) reveals the talon to all players.
- The declarer takes the 2 talon cards into their hand (now holding 12 cards).
- The declarer then discards 2 cards face-down (opponents do not see them).
- The declarer announces the game type to be played.
- The game announced must be at least equal to the winning bid level.

8.4 ALL PASS — REFE
- If all three players pass without bidding, no game is played.
- A REFE (penalty marker) is recorded. See Section 13 for refe rules.

8.5 IN-HAND GAMES (PRIJAVLJENA IGRA)
- A player may declare an "in-hand" game during the auction, meaning they
  will play WITHOUT using the talon cards.
- In-hand games are worth one bid level higher than the normal version.
- Betl and Sans can be declared in-hand.
- If a player has already declared an in-hand game, another player cannot
  declare a lower in-hand game.
- The talon remains face-down and unused for in-hand games.
- In-hand Spades (Igra Pik) cannot be declared as a second in-hand game
  if someone has already declared one. In-hand Diamonds cannot be declared
  as a third in-hand game.


========================================================================
9. FOLLOWING / WHISTING (PRACENJE)
========================================================================

9.1 DECLARING TO FOLLOW
- After the declarer announces the game, the other two players decide
  whether to FOLLOW (pratiti) or NOT FOLLOW (ne pratiti).
- The player to the declarer's right declares first: "Dodem" (I follow)
  or "Ne dodem" (I don't follow).
- Then the third player declares likewise.
- In Betl: both players automatically follow (mandatory).

9.2 WHIST OBLIGATIONS
- A player who follows (the "whister" or "pratilac") must try to take
  tricks to prevent the declarer from making their contract.
- Both followers play as PARTNERS against the declarer even though their
  scores are tracked individually.
- They should cooperate to maximize tricks taken from the declarer, even
  at the cost of one partner's individual trick count.

9.3 CALLING (ZVANJE)
- A follower may "call" (pozvati) the non-follower to join.
- The called player must then participate in play.
- The caller bears responsibility: they are penalized if the declarer takes
  more than 6 tricks, and credited for tricks the called player takes.

9.4 FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS
- A single follower must take at least 2 tricks to pass.
- Two followers together must take at least 4 tricks total.
- A player who called must, together with the called player, take at least
  4 tricks total.


========================================================================
10. KONTRA (DOUBLING)
========================================================================

10.1 KONTRA
- After the following declarations, if a follower is confident they can
  defeat the declarer, they may declare KONTRA.
- Kontra requires the followers together to take at least 5 tricks.
- All scoring points are DOUBLED when kontra is in effect.
- The player who declared kontra bears full scoring responsibility (the
  other follower assists but does not score).
- A player who did not follow automatically joins if kontra is declared.
- KONTRA IS MANDATORY when the declarer plays Spades (Pik).

10.2 REKONTRA
- If the declarer is confident they will succeed despite the kontra,
  they may declare REKONTRA.
- All points are doubled again (4x base).
- Note: Rekontra is NOT allowed against in-hand Betl (Igra Betl).

10.3 SUBKONTRA
- After rekontra, the follower may declare SUBKONTRA (8x base).

10.4 MORTKONTRA
- After subkontra, the declarer may declare MORTKONTRA (16x base).

10.5 SUMMARY OF MULTIPLIERS
  Level       | Multiplier
  ------------|----------
  Normal      | 1x
  Kontra      | 2x
  Rekontra    | 4x
  Subkontra   | 8x
  Mortkontra  | 16x


========================================================================
11. CARD PLAY
========================================================================

11.1 LEAD
- The player who bid first in the auction leads the first trick.
- Exception: In Sans, the follower to the LEFT of the declarer always
  leads, even on the first trick. Play always goes "through" the declarer.

11.2 FOLLOWING SUIT
- Players MUST follow suit (play a card of the same suit as the lead card)
  if they have one.
- This is mandatory in ALL game types.

11.3 TRUMPING
- In TRUMP GAMES (Spades, Diamonds, Hearts, Clubs): if a player cannot
  follow suit, they MUST play a trump card if they have one. Trump always
  beats non-trump cards. If multiple trumps are played, the highest wins.
- In SANS and BETL: if a player cannot follow suit, they may play ANY card
  from any suit. There is no trump.

11.4 WINNING A TRICK
- The highest card of the LED suit wins the trick, UNLESS a trump was
  played, in which case the highest trump wins.
- The trick winner leads the next trick.

11.5 TRICK REQUIREMENTS
- Trump games and Sans: declarer must take at least 6 out of 10 tricks.
- Betl: declarer must take ZERO tricks.
- Single follower: must take at least 2 tricks.
- Two followers together: must take at least 4 tricks combined.
- Follower who called: must take at least 4 tricks combined with the
  called player.
- Kontra: followers must take at least 5 tricks together.


========================================================================
12. REFE (PENALTY MARKERS)
========================================================================

12.1 WHEN REFE IS RECORDED
- When all three players pass (no one bids).
- When Spades is played without kontra being given (kontra is mandatory
  on Spades; if no kontra, a new refe is written, OR if max refes reached,
  cards are redealt).

12.2 REFE LIMITS
- The number of refes is agreed upon before the match (typically 3).
- Refe is NOT recorded if:
  - The maximum number of refes has been reached.
  - Any player is "under the hat" (below zero in bulas / in negative score).

12.3 REFE EFFECT ON SCORING
- When the declarer has unplayed refes, all scoring points are DOUBLED
  for that hand.
- After playing a hand with a refe active, the declarer marks one refe
  as played (consumed).


========================================================================
13. SCORING
========================================================================

13.1 OVERVIEW
The score sheet has three sections per player:
- BULAS (main column / "middle") — the debt each player must pay off
- SUPE (left and right columns / "juice") — recorded against opponents

13.2 STARTING BULAS
- Players agree on a starting bula total before the match (e.g., 200
  for a standard ~4-hour game, 100 for a ~2-hour game in 3-player).
- The goal is to reduce your bulas to zero.

13.3 BULA CALCULATION (DECLARER)
- PASS (prošao): Bulas DECREASE by Game_Value x 2.
- FAIL (pao): Bulas INCREASE by Game_Value x 2.

  Game base values for bula calculation:
  Game Type        | Base Value
  -----------------|----------
  Spades           | 2
  Diamonds         | 3
  Hearts           | 4
  Clubs            | 5
  Betl             | 6
  Sans             | 7
  In-Hand Spades   | 3
  In-Hand Diamonds | 4
  In-Hand Hearts   | 5
  In-Hand Clubs    | 6
  In-Hand Betl     | 7
  In-Hand Sans     | 8

- With kontra/rekontra/subkontra/mortkontra, bulas are further multiplied.
- With active refe, bulas are doubled.

13.4 SUPE CALCULATION (FOLLOWERS)
- Supe are calculated based on the number of tricks taken.
- Formula: Supe = Number_of_Tricks x Game_Value x 2
- With kontra/rekontra/subkontra/mortkontra, supe are further multiplied.
- With active refe, supe are doubled.

13.5 BETL SPECIAL SCORING
- When the declarer FAILS at Betl (takes a trick):
  - Each follower records 60 supe against the declarer.
  - For In-Hand Betl failure: 70 supe per follower.
- When the declarer PASSES at Betl: no supe are recorded for tricks
  (since the declarer took zero tricks).

13.6 THE HAT / CAP (SESIR / KAPA)
- The "hat" marks the transition from positive to negative bulas.
- When a player's bulas go below zero, they are "under the hat" (ispod kape).
- When any player is under the hat, refes are no longer recorded.

13.7 MATCH END
- The match ends when the sum of all players' bulas equals zero.
- If a match must end early, an "otpisivanje" (write-off) is performed:
  bulas are equally reduced so the sum reaches zero.

13.8 FINAL RESULT CALCULATION
  Final_Result = -(Sum_of_Your_Supe_Against_Opponents)
                 + (Sum_of_Opponents_Supe_Against_You)
                 + (Final_Bulas x 10)

- A NEGATIVE result is good (you won).
- A POSITIVE result is bad (you lost).
- Traditionally, players may invert the signs (+ for good, - for bad).


========================================================================
14. CARD PLAY OBLIGATIONS & PARTNERSHIPS
========================================================================

14.1 FOLLOWERS AS PARTNERS
- The two followers play as a team against the declarer.
- They must cooperate to maximize tricks taken from the declarer, even
  when this disadvantages one follower's individual trick count.
- A called player or a player joining due to kontra must play to help
  the active follower, not for personal gain.

14.2 MUST-FOLLOW AND MUST-TRUMP RULES
In trump games, strict rules apply:
1. You MUST follow suit if you can.
2. If you cannot follow suit, you MUST trump if you can.
3. Only if you have neither the led suit nor trump may you play any card.

In Betl and Sans:
1. You MUST follow suit if you can.
2. If you cannot follow suit, you may play ANY card (no trumping obligation).


========================================================================
15. SPECIAL RULES AND COMMON AGREEMENTS
========================================================================

15.1 SPADES WITHOUT KONTRA
- Since kontra is mandatory on Spades, if no kontra is given:
  - If there are unplayed refes: a new refe is recorded instead of playing.
  - If all refes are used: cards are redealt.
  - If any player is under the hat: the Spades declarer "drops" without
    play (takes the penalty automatically).

15.2 SANS LEAD CONVENTIONS
- If no one bid during the auction and Sans is played, and you are called
  to play, lead from Clubs.
- If kontra was given on Sans, lead from Spades.

15.3 LAST HAND RULE
- If it is the last hand of the match and the declarer fails, the failure
  may be scored as double or normal (by pre-game agreement).

15.4 COMMON PRE-GAME AGREEMENTS
Players may agree on optional rules before a match:
- A player who stops bidding at levels 2-5 must have at least 3 trumps.
- A player who follows on Spades must have at least two Aces or one
  trump trick and one Ace.
- When only one player follows, the follower and declarer may negotiate
  on the number of tricks (agree on a split without playing it out).
- "Obvious" bad plays may be penalized as a fail by group consensus.

15.5 REKONTRA RESTRICTION
- Rekontra is NOT given against In-Hand Betl (Igra Betl / Uver Betl).


========================================================================
16. ETIQUETTE AND CODE OF CONDUCT
========================================================================

- Never cheat, peek at others' cards, or reveal your own prematurely.
- Behave courteously before, during, and after play.
- Acknowledge opponents' good play.
- Use only standard game vocabulary.
- Maintain composure ("poker face") — do not react to cards played.
- Spectators must remain silent and expressionless during play.
- Accept losses gracefully — blame your own play, not the cards.
- Do not rush players who are thinking about their decisions.
- Fellowship and sportsmanship are more important than winning.
